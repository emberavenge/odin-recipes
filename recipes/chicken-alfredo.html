    <h1>Quick One-Pot Chicken Alfredo</h1>
        <img src="chickenalfredo.jpg" alt="A plate of chicken-alfredo pasta">
    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Chicken alfredo combines a creamy pasta sauce with tender slices of lean protein. The white meat is butterflied for quick cooking and seasoned for maximum flavor. The heavy cream reduces until a smooth and velvety sauce is able to cling to the fettuccine noodles.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>½ pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>2 cups milk</li>
            <li>1 large clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>8 ounces fettucine, broken in half </li>
            <li>½ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>¾ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving </li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice each chicken breast horizontally into 3 thinner pieces using a sharp knife. Sprinkle each chicken piece with garlic salt and Italian seasoning on both sides.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until golden and cooked through, about 2 minutes per side. Remove onto a plate.</li>
            <li>Add milk and garlic to the skillet. Bring to a simmer and add fettuccine. Cook, stirring every 30 seconds to prevent sticking until pasta has softened, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring every couple of minutes, 6 to 7 minutes more. Stir in cream and Parmesan cheese. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce has thickened and pasta is cooked, about 2 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately and garnish with additional Parmesan cheese if desired.</li>
        </ol>
